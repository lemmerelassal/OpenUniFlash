# OpenUniFlash

OpenUniFlash is the same universal programmer you know and love from 2012. After a lot of work by Ago (Axel Gembe) , BMX and myself, it's time to let go of it and let the public make it an even better product.

You can now look into how this thing works and that it's very easy to use.

All you need is a FIFO capable interface, for example, FT2232. Or maybe something newer - I took a big break from electronics and dedicated myself to studying chemistry in 2013 (more specifically - drug design. I even won in the first round of a competition earlier this year).

The directory structure should be obvious. Feel free to contribute.

Best wishes,
OPS team
